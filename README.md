Implementation:
The code consists of HTML markup for the user interface, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for handling user input and performing conversion calculations. Each conversion (e.g., meters to feet, liters to gallons) is implemented as a separate JavaScript function, ensuring modularity and ease of maintenance. A central function (displayConversions) orchestrates the conversion process, retrieving input values, performing calculations, and updating the DOM to display the conversion results.

Usage:

- Enter a numerical value in any of the input fields based on the unit you want to convert from (e.g., meters, liters, kilograms).
- The tool dynamically calculates and displays the equivalent values in all other supported units for length, volume, and mass.
- Conversion results are updated in real-time as you type, providing instant feedback on the converted values.
